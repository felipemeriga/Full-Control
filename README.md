This repository covers the development of an SmartHome web application built with nodejs(Express) for the backend, and Angular 4 for the 
frontend. Using a raspberry pi, the webserver is serving the angular static files and listening to REST API calls. With this sample app, you can control the light bulbs and airconditioners.
